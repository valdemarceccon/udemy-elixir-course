# Cards

Inicial project, developed in the udemy elixir and phoenix course.

For each commit/step in this project was added a tag, to help myself in the future to find specifics points, if needed.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cards` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:cards, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/cards](https://hexdocs.pm/cards).
